I will definitely be more careful about spending the required productive hours in DA.

As far as the incident is concerned :

路         I took proper permission from you before leaving, and I will make sure to seek it in an email going forward

路         As you know, I had a high priority deliverable from the Client side on Monday and Tuesday which I completed on top priority before leaving along with the QC on Wednesday but I will make sure to go for the buffer approach when possible
